- ExerciseDB API pricing and rate limits need verification before production use

**Phase 4 - Privacy Sensitive:**
- Photo storage requires encryption strategy and GDPR compliance research

**Phase 5 - Platform Complexity:**
- Health Connect and HealthKit have different data models requiring normalization strategy
- Deduplication logic needed to prevent duplicate workout imports

**Phase 6 - Data Dependency:**
- Intelligence features require minimum 30+ workouts per user for meaningful recommendations
