# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-10
**Phases:** 1-7 (Phase 5 deferred)
**Total Plans:** 28

## Overview

Transformed LagomStronk from a basic workout tracker into a feature-complete intelligent fitness companion. Built technical foundations (storage, events), modernized UX with custom components, added workout intelligence and gamification, implemented body tracking, and shipped polished documentation. All features implemented in vanilla JavaScript as a PWA.

- Configurable rest timer with Media Session API lock screen controls
- Coaching suggestions including missed muscle groups and adherence streaks

### Phase 4: Body Tracking
**Goal**: Enable comprehensive body progress tracking with measurements and photos
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (storage infrastructure required)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Body tracking data model + weight tracking UI (hero)
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Muscle measurements + body fat % tracking

**Details:**
- Body weight tracking with trend chart visualization
- Muscle measurements (bicep, chest, waist, thigh) with individual trend charts
- Body fat % logging with history
- Same-date update logic for measurements
- Non-zero Y-axis charts for progress visibility
- Mint-colored gradients matching app theme

### Phase 5: Health Integration — DEFERRED
**Goal**: Sync workout and body data with native health platforms
**Status**: DEFERRED — Requires Capacitor/native wrapper for Health Connect and HealthKit API access
**Depends on**: Phase 1, Phase 4, Capacitor integration

### Phase 6: Gamification & Intelligence
**Goal**: Add engagement systems and adaptive intelligence that makes training effortless
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 3
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Onboarding & user profile wizard

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Native EventTarget over custom event bus (zero dependencies)
- idb-keyval for IndexedDB (minimal, async-first)
- Custom numpad overlay (matches design spec)
- Spotify-style mini-player (workout context on any screen)
- 6-tab bottom nav at 0.55rem labels (fits 375px)
- Media Session API for rest timer (lock screen without native)
- All intelligence rule-based, no AI/ML (deterministic, explainable)
- Heatmap as colored blocks, not anatomical diagram (simple implementation)

**Issues Resolved:**
- UAT-001: Workout screen architecture (resolved in 02-10)
- UAT-002/003/004: Numpad fixes and animation polish (resolved in 02-11)
- UAT-005: Workout flow gaps (resolved in 02-10)
- ISS-001: Hero section customization — tracked for future
- ISS-002: Customizable body tracking visualizations — tracked for future

**Issues Deferred:**
- Phase 5 (Health Integration) — requires Capacitor/native wrapper
- BODY-04/05 (Progress photos) — out of scope per CONTEXT
- DOCS-02/03 (User guide, architecture docs) — out of scope per CONTEXT

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- No framework — works well for current scope but may limit scaling
- All state in IndexedDB with no backup/export mechanism
- No automated tests (Puppeteer used for screenshot capture only)
