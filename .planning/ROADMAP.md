# Roadmap: LagomStronk

## Overview

This roadmap transforms LagomStronk from a functional workout tracker into an intelligent fitness companion. The journey addresses critical technical foundations first (storage migration, architecture refactoring), then fills table stakes gaps (rest timer, PR detection, exercise system), and finally adds differentiation through body tracking, health platform integration, and intelligence features. Each phase delivers complete, verifiable user value while building toward a feature set that makes strength training feel effortless.
