<objective>
Rewrite the README as a polished GitHub showcase that sells the LagomStronk experience visually and emotionally.

Purpose: The README is the storefront — the first thing anyone sees. It needs to immediately convey what the app is, what makes it special, and that it was built with passion.
Output: Polished README.md with screenshots, feature grid, user journey walkthrough, and personal tone.

# Phase context summary (all prior phases complete):
# - Phase 1: Storage abstraction (IndexedDB), event bus, toast notifications
# - Phase 2: Dashboard hero (streak, calendar, stats), exercise library, custom numpad, workout history calendar, mini-player, confetti animations, custom exercise wizard
# - Phase 3: Training programs (PPL, 5x5, custom), coach intelligence, PR detection with gold confetti celebrations, rest timer with lock screen controls
# - Phase 4: Body weight tracking with charts, muscle measurements (bicep/chest/waist/thigh), body fat % tracking
# - Phase 6: Onboarding wizard, achievements/badges, weekly streaks with rest-day logic, PR feed timeline, intelligence engine (recommendations, recovery, fatigue), insights dashboard (quality scores, trends, muscle heatmap)

# Current README is barebones (43 lines, lists only 5 generic features)
@README.md
@index.html

# Design references:
# - Mint (#D1FFC6) primary color scheme
# - No logo file exists in icons/ (only .gitkeep)
# - docs/ directory exists but is empty
# - design/color-palette.md and inspiration/numpad.jpg exist

**Constraining decisions from CONTEXT.md:**
- NO contributor/architecture docs (out of scope)
- NO detailed user guide (out of scope)
- README only — the sole deliverable
- Visual-first: hero screenshot/GIF at top, feature grid, user journey
- Personal, passionate tone — not corporate

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Capture app screenshots for README</name>
  <files>docs/screenshots/dashboard.png, docs/screenshots/workout.png, docs/screenshots/numpad.png, docs/screenshots/progress.png, docs/screenshots/body.png</files>
  <action>
Use Puppeteer to capture screenshots of the app running locally. Start the app with `npx serve . -l 3456` in the background.

Screenshots needed (all at mobile viewport 375x812, device scale factor 2 for retina quality):
1. **dashboard.png** — Today view showing hero section with streak, 7-day calendar, volume chart, stat cards. Seed some demo data into localStorage first so the dashboard shows a realistic state (5-day streak, volume bars, recent PRs).
2. **workout.png** — Active workout view with exercises and logged sets, showing the inline SET | PREVIOUS | KG | REPS | ✓ UI. Include the mini-player bar at bottom.
3. **numpad.png** — The custom numpad overlay open, showing the distinctive numpad design.
4. **progress.png** — Progress view showing PR feed timeline and insights (quality score chart, muscle heatmap).
5. **body.png** — Body tracking tab showing weight trend chart and measurement entries.

Save to `docs/screenshots/` directory. Use PNG format.

**Seed data approach:** Before screenshots, inject realistic demo data via page.evaluate() setting localStorage keys:
- `lagomstronk_workouts`: 10-15 workouts over last 2 weeks with PRs
- `lagomstronk_exercises`: standard exercise list
- `lagomstronk_body_data`: weight entries showing downward trend
- `lagomstronk_user_profile`: completed onboarding with goals

After capturing, kill the serve process.

**What to avoid:** Don't use screenshot tools that produce blurry images — use deviceScaleFactor: 2. Don't capture at desktop width — this is a mobile-first PWA, always use 375px width.

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open each screenshot in docs/screenshots/:
       - dashboard.png — Hero section visible with streak, calendar, stats
       - workout.png — Active workout with sets logged
       - numpad.png — Custom numpad overlay visible
       - progress.png — PR feed and insights visible
       - body.png — Weight chart and measurements visible
    2. Confirm screenshots look polished (retina quality, mobile viewport, realistic data)
    3. Confirm mint color scheme is visible
    4. Note any screenshots that need to be retaken or adjusted

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite README as polished showcase</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite README.md completely. Structure:

**1. Hero Section (top)**
- Centered app name "LagomStronk" with tagline
- Build badge (keep existing GitHub Actions badge)
- Hero screenshot — use the dashboard screenshot as the main visual, displayed large and centered
- One-liner pitch: strength training that feels effortless and intelligent

**2. Feature Showcase Grid**
Use a visual grid layout (markdown table or HTML) showing the standout features with emoji icons:
- 🏋️ Smart Workout Logging — inline sets with previous hints, custom numpad
- 🏆 PR Detection & Celebrations — automatic PR tracking with gold confetti
- 📊 Intelligence Engine — exercise recommendations, recovery insights, fatigue detection
- 🔥 Streaks & Achievements — weekly streaks with rest-day logic, 11 badges to earn
- 📈 Progress Tracking — quality scores, trend analysis, muscle heatmap
- 💪 Body Tracking — weight, measurements, body fat % with trend charts
- 📱 Training Programs — PPL, 5x5, custom programs with coach hints
- ⏱️ Rest Timer — configurable timer with lock screen media controls

**3. User Journey Walkthrough**
Show the flow with screenshots inline:
- Dashboard → Start Workout → Log Sets (with numpad) → Track Progress → Body Tracking
Use 3-4 screenshots in a horizontal row (HTML img tags with width constraints for side-by-side)

**4. Tech Stack**
Brief section: Vanilla JS, IndexedDB, Chart.js, Canvas Confetti, PWA, Capacitor (Android)

**5. Quick Start**
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
And Android build command.

**6. Personal note**
Brief personal touch about why this was built — a labor of love for someone who lifts.

**Tone:** Personal, passionate, not corporate. Use "I" voice where appropriate. Show pride in the craft.

**What to avoid:** Don't make it look like a generic template. Don't use walls of text before first visual. Don't list features as a boring bullet list — use the grid. Don't include contributor guidelines, architecture docs, or API specs (per CONTEXT boundaries).
