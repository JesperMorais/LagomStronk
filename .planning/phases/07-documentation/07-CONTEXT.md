# Phase 7: Documentation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The README is the final touch — it's the storefront for LagomStronk on GitHub. When someone lands on the repo, they should immediately feel that this was built by someone who actually lifts and cares deeply about the craft. Not a corporate product, not a tutorial project — a personal, passionate creation.

The README should sell the experience visually. A big hero screenshot or GIF right at the top that immediately shows what the app looks and feels like — the mint theme, the custom numpad, the dashboard. Below that, a clean feature grid with icons showing what makes it special. Then a walkthrough showing the user journey: dashboard, starting a workout, logging sets, tracking progress.

The vibe is personal and passionate. This is a labor of love, and that should come through in how it's presented.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual showcase** — Screenshots and GIFs that make the app look and feel great. The mint theme, custom numpad, dashboard hero, workout flow. Visuals are the #1 priority.
- **Hero visual at the top** — Immediately show what this is. No walls of text before the first screenshot.
- **Feature storytelling** — Highlight what makes it special: intelligence engine, gamification, custom numpad, body tracking, PR celebrations.

## What's Out of Scope

- No contributor/architecture docs — this is a personal project, not an open-source team effort
- No detailed user guide — the app should be intuitive enough on its own
- No deployment/hosting documentation — it's a PWA, just serve the files
- No API documentation or technical specs

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Hero screenshot or GIF right at the top — big, eye-catching, immediately shows the app
- Feature grid with icons and short descriptions — clean visual layout of capabilities
- User journey walkthrough (dashboard -> workout -> tracking -> progress) showing the flow
- Open to creative presentation beyond these — surprise me with what looks good

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is the final phase of the project. All features are built (Phases 1-6 complete). The documentation phase is purely about presentation — making the repo look great when someone discovers it. The focus is entirely on the README as a showcase piece.
