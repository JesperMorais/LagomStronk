# Phase 3: Workout Features - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** Ready for research

## How This Should Work

When you open the app, your programmed workout for today is front and center on the dashboard. One tap and you're in — the program tells you which exercises, sets, and reps to do. But it's not rigid: you can swap exercises, adjust as needed.

The magic is in the intelligence. The app learns from your history. If you skipped triceps in your last push session, it suggests making up for it. When you're ready to progress, it tells you — "Nice! Last time you hit 80kg, try 82.5?" It's like having a coach who knows your history and gives friendly, data-driven suggestions.

Programs are classic templates — PPL, 5x5, Upper/Lower, bro splits, full body, PHUL. Pick one and follow it. Hevy-style clean program cards with a calendar view of the week showing what's ahead. The UI is minimal friction — today's workout is obvious, starting it is instant.

When life happens and you miss a day, the program forgives and adapts. No guilt, no penalty. It adjusts and suggests what makes sense now based on your actual training pattern.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Follow a program** - Pick a template, see today's workout, track adherence across weeks
- **Smart suggestions** - App notices patterns and suggests what to do based on history (e.g., making up for missed muscle groups)
- **Progressive overload** - Automatic weight/rep recommendations that push you forward based on your actual performance
- **Dashboard integration** - Today's programmed workout shown prominently on home screen with one-tap start
- **Broader template selection** - 5-8 programs covering PPL, 5x5, Upper/Lower, bro splits, full body, PHUL

## What's Out of Scope

- Social features (sharing workouts, comparing with friends) - future milestone
- Complex periodization (deload weeks, mesocycles, advanced programming)
- Custom program builder (creating programs from scratch) - just use templates for now
- Rest timer with lock screen controls - can follow if scope allows, not priority
- Plate calculator - can follow if scope allows, not priority
- PR tracking and celebration - can follow if scope allows, not priority

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Hevy-style program cards — clean, calendar view of the week, clear progression
- Coach-like guidance that feels like a workout buddy + analyst: "Nice! Last time you hit 80kg, try 82.5?" combined with "Based on your last 3 sessions, you're ready to progress"
- Minimal friction — one tap to start today's programmed workout
- Forgive and adapt — missed workouts don't break the program, it adjusts intelligently
- Templates are customizable — swap exercises, adjust reps, but the structure guides you

## Additional Context

Programs are the priority for this phase. The roadmap mentions rest timer, PR tracking, and plate calculator — these are nice-to-have if scope allows, but the intelligent program system is non-negotiable.

The intelligence layer (smart suggestions, progressive overload hints, pattern recognition) is what makes this feel effortless rather than just another workout tracker. This is the differentiator.

User wants both encouraging buddy energy AND data-driven reasoning — friendly but analytical.
