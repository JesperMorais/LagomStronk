## Metadata
```yaml
wave: 2
depends_on: [02-02]
files_modified:
  - js/app.js
  - css/style.css
  - index.html
autonomous: true
```

## Goal
Enhance exercise library with search, filter drawer, favorites, and switchable list/grid view.

## Context
User wants:
- Switchable list/grid view
- Filter drawer with muscle groups and equipment chips
- Search input at top
- Favorites via long-press
- Recently used exercises at top

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Update library view HTML:
- Search input with icon
- Filter button that opens drawer
- View toggle (list/grid icons)
- Recent exercises chips section
</task>

<task id="2">
Add filter drawer HTML:
- Overlay + side panel (slides from right)
- Muscle group chips (multi-select)
- Equipment chips (multi-select)
- Clear All / Apply buttons
</task>

<task id="3">
Add filter drawer CSS:
- Slide-in animation from right
- Overlay with backdrop blur
- Chip styling (toggle active state)
- z-index: 1000
</task>

<task id="4">
Add library functions to app.js:
- renderLibraryView() - shows list with filters applied
- filterExercises(query, muscleGroups, equipment)
- toggleFavorite(exerciseName)
- getRecentExercises() - last 5 used
- toggleLibraryView() - list/grid switch
</task>

<task id="5">
TEST: Go to Library view, verify:
- Search filters as you type
- Filter drawer opens/closes
- Selecting muscle groups filters list
- Long-press shows favorite option
- View toggle switches layout
</task>

## Verification
```bash
grep -q "filter-drawer" css/style.css && echo "✓ Filter drawer CSS exists"
grep -q "renderLibraryView" js/app.js && echo "✓ Library render exists"
```

## Must Haves
- [ ] Search input filters exercises
- [ ] Filter drawer opens with chips
- [ ] Muscle group filter works
- [ ] Equipment filter works
- [ ] Recent exercises shown at top
- [ ] List/grid toggle works
