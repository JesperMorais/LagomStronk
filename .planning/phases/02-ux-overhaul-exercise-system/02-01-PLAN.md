# Plan 02-01: Dashboard Hero Section

## Metadata
```yaml
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified:
  - js/app.js
  - css/style.css
  - index.html
autonomous: true
```

## Goal
Add hero section to Today view with streak display (flame + 7-day calendar) and 2 smaller stat cards below.

## Context
User wants: "Hero + sections layout: large featured area with smaller sections below"
- Streak: flame icon + number + 7-day calendar mini-view
- Two smaller cards below hero (This Week volume + Recent PRs)
- Mint color scheme, dark backgrounds

Current base: Simple inline sets UI that works well. We ADD the hero above the exercise list, not replace anything.

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Add hero section HTML to index.html above today-exercises div:
- Hero container with streak display (flame emoji + streak number)
- 7-day calendar row showing M T W T F S S with dots for workout days
- Two stat cards row below: "This Week" volume + "Recent PRs"
</task>

<task id="2">
Add hero CSS to style.css:
- .dashboard-hero with gradient background matching color palette
- .streak-display with flame icon styling
- .week-calendar with day dots (mint for workout days)
- .stats-row with two .stat-card elements side by side
- Use existing mint (#D1FFC6) and dark backgrounds
</task>

<task id="3">
Add streak calculation to app.js:
- calculateStreak() function that counts consecutive workout days
- getWeekWorkoutDays() to get which days this week have workouts
- renderHero() function called from renderTodayView()
</task>

<task id="4">
Add stat card data functions:
- getThisWeekVolume() - sum of weight × reps for current week
- getRecentPRs() - get last 3 PRs from workout history
- Display in the two stat cards
</task>

<task id="5">
TEST: Open app in browser, verify:
- Hero displays with streak (or 0 if no workouts)
- Week calendar shows correct day highlighted
- Stat cards show volume and PRs (or empty state)
- Inline sets still work below hero
</task>

## Verification
```bash
# Check hero section exists
grep -q "dashboard-hero" index.html && echo "✓ Hero HTML exists"
grep -q "dashboard-hero" css/style.css && echo "✓ Hero CSS exists"
grep -q "calculateStreak\|renderHero" js/app.js && echo "✓ Hero JS exists"
```

## Must Haves
- [ ] Hero section visible on Today view
- [ ] Streak number displays (0 for new users)
- [ ] 7-day calendar shows current week
- [ ] Two stat cards visible below hero
- [ ] Existing inline sets functionality unchanged
