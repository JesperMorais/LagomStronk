# Plan 02-09: Custom Exercise Wizard

## Metadata
```yaml
wave: 4
depends_on: [02-02, 02-05]
files_modified:
  - js/app.js
  - css/style.css
  - index.html
autonomous: true
```

## Goal
Create guided wizard for adding custom exercises with muscle groups and equipment.

## Context
User wants:
- Wizard flow: name -> muscle groups -> equipment -> confirm
- Custom exercise indicator: subtle user icon, no text badge
- Multiple entry points: header +, FAB, empty state CTA

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Add wizard modal HTML:
- Multi-step modal with progress indicator
- Step 1: Exercise name input
- Step 2: Muscle group chips (primary + secondary)
- Step 3: Equipment selection
- Step 4: Confirmation summary
- Back/Next/Finish buttons
</task>

<task id="2">
Add wizard CSS:
- Modal styling matching app theme
- Step indicator (dots or numbers)
- Chip selection styling
- Smooth transitions between steps
</task>

<task id="3">
Add wizard functions:
- openExerciseWizard() - start wizard
- wizardNextStep() / wizardPrevStep()
- saveCustomExercise() - saves with metadata
- Validation (name required, at least one muscle group)
</task>

<task id="4">
Add entry points:
- "Add Custom" button in Library view
- Option in exercise search when no results
- Update addCustomExercise() to include metadata
</task>

<task id="5">
TEST: Create a custom exercise, verify:
- All wizard steps work
- Can select multiple muscle groups
- Exercise appears in library with user icon
- Exercise appears in search results
- Metadata saved correctly
</task>

## Verification
```bash
grep -q "exercise-wizard\|wizard-modal" css/style.css && echo "✓ Wizard CSS exists"
grep -q "openExerciseWizard" js/app.js && echo "✓ Wizard JS exists"
```

## Must Haves
- [ ] Wizard opens from multiple entry points
- [ ] All 4 steps functional
- [ ] Custom exercise saves with metadata
- [ ] User icon indicator on custom exercises
