# Plan 02-06: Workout Logging UX (Animations & Hints)

## Metadata
```yaml
wave: 3
depends_on: [02-04]
files_modified:
  - js/app.js
  - css/style.css
autonomous: true
```

## Goal
Add checkmark animations, confetti, and previous set hints to workout logging.

## Context
User wants:
- Previous set hints as greyed placeholder text
- Checkmark pop animation + row highlight + small confetti burst
- Row stays highlighted after completion

Current inline sets already have checkmark button - enhance it.

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Enhance previous set hints:
- Show "Last: 60 x 10" as placeholder in inputs
- Grey color for hint text
- Only show if previous workout data exists
</task>

<task id="2">
Add checkmark animation CSS:
- Scale pop effect (0 -> 1.2 -> 1)
- SVG checkmark with stroke animation
- Row background highlight (mint at 15% opacity)
- Transition timing: 0.3s ease-out
</task>

<task id="3">
Add confetti on set completion:
- Include canvas-confetti from CDN
- 20 mint-colored particles
- Origin at checkmark button position
- Only on completing a set (not unchecking)
</task>

<task id="4">
Update toggleSetCompletion() in app.js:
- Trigger animations on completion
- Keep row highlighted after completion
- Optional: haptic feedback if supported
</task>

<task id="5">
TEST: Complete a set, verify:
- Checkmark animates with pop effect
- Row highlights with mint tint
- Small confetti burst appears
- Feels satisfying to tap
</task>

## Verification
```bash
grep -q "confetti" index.html && echo "✓ Confetti script included"
grep -q "set-complete-animation\|checkmark" css/style.css && echo "✓ Animation CSS exists"
```

## Must Haves
- [ ] Previous set values shown as hints
- [ ] Checkmark has pop animation
- [ ] Row highlights on completion
- [ ] Confetti appears on set completion
