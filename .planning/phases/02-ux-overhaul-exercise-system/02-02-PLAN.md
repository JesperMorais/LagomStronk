# Plan 02-02: Exercise Metadata Model

## Metadata
```yaml
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified:
  - js/data.js
autonomous: true
```

## Goal
Add muscle group and equipment metadata to exercises for filtering and recommendations.

## Context
User wants detailed exercise metadata:
- 12+ muscle groups with sub-group tracking
- Primary + secondary muscle targets
- 10+ equipment types (Barbell, Dumbbell, Machine, Cable, etc.)

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Add MUSCLE_GROUPS constant to data.js:
- chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, forearms
- quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves
- abs, obliques
- Each with display name
</task>

<task id="2">
Add EQUIPMENT_TYPES constant to data.js:
- Barbell, Dumbbell, EZ Bar, Machine, Cable
- Smith Machine, Kettlebell, Resistance Band, Bodyweight, Other
</task>

<task id="3">
Add EXERCISE_METADATA object mapping exercise names to:
- primaryMuscles: array of muscle group IDs
- secondaryMuscles: array of muscle group IDs  
- equipment: equipment type ID
Cover all DEFAULT_EXERCISES in the library
</task>

<task id="4">
Add helper functions:
- getExerciseMetadata(exerciseName) - returns metadata or default
- filterExercisesByMuscle(muscleGroup) - returns matching exercises
- filterExercisesByEquipment(equipment) - returns matching exercises
</task>

<task id="5">
TEST: Console test the functions:
- getExerciseMetadata('Bench Press') returns chest/triceps/barbell
- filterExercisesByMuscle('chest') includes Bench Press
- Unknown exercises return sensible defaults
</task>

## Verification
```bash
grep -q "MUSCLE_GROUPS" js/data.js && echo "✓ Muscle groups defined"
grep -q "EQUIPMENT_TYPES" js/data.js && echo "✓ Equipment types defined"
grep -q "EXERCISE_METADATA" js/data.js && echo "✓ Exercise metadata defined"
```

## Must Haves
- [ ] All default exercises have metadata
- [ ] Muscle groups cover major body parts (12+)
- [ ] Equipment types cover common gym equipment (10+)
- [ ] Filter functions work correctly
