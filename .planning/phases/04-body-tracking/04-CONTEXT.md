# Phase 4: Body Tracking - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** Ready for research

## How This Should Work

Body tracking is weight-focused with body composition as the secondary concern. The main experience is stepping on the scale, logging your weight, and seeing your trend over time. It should feel like opening a fitness journal — your numbers, your progress, at a glance.

A dedicated "Body" tab in the bottom navigation gives this proper real estate. When you tap it, you see your weight chart front and center — the trend that tells your story. Below that, measurements for the four key areas (bicep, chest, waist, thigh) each with their own charts.

Logging is flexible — no expected cadence, just log when you do. Whether daily or weekly, the app adapts to your rhythm without judgment.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Weight trend clarity** — The chart showing weight over time must be easy to read and motivating. This is the hero of the phase.
- **Progress visibility** — Seeing the change over weeks/months at a glance. The trend tells the story.
- **All four measurements matter** — Bicep, chest, waist, thigh — full body tracking for comprehensive progress, each with individual trend charts.

## What's Out of Scope

- **Progress photos** — Defer photo capture and comparison to a later phase
- **Body composition estimation** — No Navy method calculators or estimation tools; manual entry only for body fat %
- **Health app sync** — That's Phase 5; for now just manual entry
- **Logging reminders/cadence** — Flexible whenever logging, no nudges

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- New bottom nav tab for Body/Progress
- Weight chart as the hero element
- Individual charts for each measurement (not combined)
- Manual body fat % entry (for smart scale users who know their numbers)
- No specific design requirements — open to following existing design system

</specifics>

## Additional Context

Phase 5 (Health Integration) will bring automatic imports from health apps. This phase establishes the data model and UI that Phase 5 will populate.

Body composition estimation could be a nice-to-have in a future phase, but for now keeping it simple with manual entry.
